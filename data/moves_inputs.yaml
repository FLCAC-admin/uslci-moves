# FHWA's Office of Operations has reliable average payload estimates for
# single unit (SU) and combination (CU) trucks over time based on data 
# from the Vehicle Inventory and Use Survey (VIUS) from 2002 and more 
# recently from US DOT's Freight Analysis Framework (FAF)
# [see Chpt. 12, Table 42].
# https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/fhwahop20011/chap12.htm
# Data averaged across the 3 year data points
# Also, there is no indication that payloads will vary according to 
# route/daily mileage, so I think we should apply them to both the 
# short-haul (< 200 miles per day) and long-haul (200+ miles per day) 
# source types.
payloads:
  single unit truck:
    payload: 6.94 # short tons
    units: tons
  combination truck:
    payload: 16.18 # short tons
    units: tons
  light commercial truck:
    payload: 1.0 # no data for light-duty trucks, assume 1 ton
    units: tons

        EPA uses extensive in-use measurements through a variety of sources,
        including dynamometer readings over defined drive cycles, real-world portable

        drive-through test sheds).
