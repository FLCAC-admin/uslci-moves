        EPA uses extensive in-use measurements through a variety of sources,
        including dynamometer readings over defined drive cycles, real-world portable
        emissions monitoring, and even some remote sensing data (often employing
        drive-through test sheds). Ultimately the final emission factor is a function
        of both these emissions monitoring and calculations.
