## General Information

description: >
    This dataset represents the movement of goods via a [VEHICLE_TYPE].
    Emissions and fuel consumption data are calculated using EPA's Motor Vehicle
    Emission Simulator (MOVES), the regulatory model to determine emission
    inventories for highway vehicles, including cars, trucks, and buses. The
    reference flow is the movement of 1 metric ton of goods for a distance of
    1 km.

time_description: >
    This process reflects the vehicle fleet as estimated in [YEAR]. MOVES calculates
    an age distribution by vehicle type, where age is defined as the difference
    between a vehicle's model year and the year of analysis.
    MOVES employs a number of different age dependent factors, including deterioration
    of engine and emission after-treatment technology due to tampering and
    mal-maintenance, vehicle scrappage and fleet turnover and mileage accumulation
    over the lifetime of the vehicle.

    This process represents emissions from vehicles operating in the following
    U.S. states: [STATES].

    This process represents emissions from vehicles operating in all U.S. states.

    light_commercial_truck: >
        Light-duty trucks include pickups, most sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and vans.
        In MOVES, passenger trucks and light commercial trucks are defined using FHWA's
        vehicle classification, which specifies that light-duty vehicles are those weighing
        less than 10,000 pounds, specifically vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR)
        in Class 1 and 2 (including 2a and 2b). An exception to this is that Class 2b
        trucks (8,500 to 10,000 lbs) with two axles or more and at least six tires,
        colloquially known as "duallies", are classified into the single unit truck
        category. A light-duty truck is considered a light commercial truck if it
        is registered to an organization or business. 
    
    single_unit_truck: >
        Single unit source types in MOVES include refuse trucks, single unit short-haul
        trucks, single unit long-haul trucks and motor homes. FHWA's vehicle classification
        specifies that single unit trucks are singleframe trucks with a gross vehicle
        weight rating of greater than 10,000 pounds or with two axles and at least six
        tires—colloquially known as "dualies". The single unit truck vehicle category
        is quite diverse, including (but not limited to) delivery, box, flatbed,
        cement mixers, and tow trucks, among other body styles and vocations. 
    
    single_unit_truck_short_haul: >
        FHWA's vehicle classification specifies that single unit trucks are singleframe
        trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of greater than 10,000 pounds or
        with two axles and at least six tires—colloquially known as "dualies".
        The single unit truck vehicle category is quite diverse, including
        (but not limited to) delivery, box, flatbed, cement mixers, and tow trucks,
        among other body styles and vocations. This source type includes all single
        unit trucks that are not refuse trucks or motor homes, which travel less than
        or equal to 200 miles a day.
    
    single_unit_truck_long_haul: >
        FHWA's vehicle classification specifies that single unit trucks are singleframe
        trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of greater than 10,000 pounds or
        with two axles and at least six tires—colloquially known as "dualies".
        The single unit truck vehicle category is quite diverse, including
        (but not limited to) delivery, box, flatbed, cement mixers, and tow trucks,
        among other body styles and vocations. This source type includes all single
        unit trucks that are not refuse trucks or motor homes, which travel more than
        200 miles a day.
    
    combination_truck: >
        Combination trucks in MOVES include two source types, short-haul and long-haul
        combination trucks. These are heavy-duty trucks that are not single-frame.
        Instead, they consist of a tractor and one or more trailers. Combination trucks
        are categorized in the medium heavy-duty (Class 6 and 7) regulatory class or
        the heavy heavy-duty (Class 8) regulatory class.
    
    combination_truck_short_haul: >
        Combination trucks in MOVES include two source types, short-haul and long-haul
        combination trucks. These are heavy-duty trucks that are not single-frame.
        Instead, they consist of a tractor and one or more trailers. Combination trucks
        are categorized in the medium heavy-duty (Class 6 and 7) regulatory class or
        the heavy heavy-duty (Class 8) regulatory class.
        Short-haul combination trucks travel less than or equal to 200 miles a day.
        Frequently, these trucks are older than long-haul combination trucks and they
        are often purchased in secondary markets, such as for drayage applications,
        after being used primarily for long-haul trips.
    
    combination_truck_long_haul: >
        Combination trucks in MOVES include two source types, short-haul and long-haul
        combination trucks. These are heavy-duty trucks that are not single-frame.
        Instead, they consist of a tractor and one or more trailers. Combination trucks
        are categorized in the medium heavy-duty (Class 6 and 7) regulatory class or
        the heavy heavy-duty (Class 8) regulatory class.
        Long-haul combination trucks travel more than 200 miles a day. These trucks
        frequently have a sleeper cab, allowing the driver to "hotel" in their truck
        during mandated rest times.

## Data Source information

completeness_description: >
    Included in the inventory are emissions from operations (i.e., tailpipe exhaust)
    as well as idling and truck hotelling (both extended engine idling and auxiliary
    power unit use). Particulate matter from brake and tire wear is also included.
    Evaporative emissions while the vehicle is soaking (engine off) are not included.
    Manufacturing of vehicles, roads, and other infrastructure are not included in
    this dataset.

data_selection_description: >
    MOVES runs were performed at the default settings at the state level.

data_treatment_description: >
    MOVES combines in-use emission rates and detailed fleet populations and activity,
    frequently in the form of vehicle miles or kilometers traveled, to calculate inventories.

    Average payload estimates are required to calculate LCI data per unit of good transported.
    The average payloads by MOVES source type were estimated from the 2002 Vehicle
    Inventory and Use Survey conducted by the US Census Bureau and 2012 and 2017
    Freight Analysis Framework (FAF) statistics collected by the Federal Highway
    Administration.

    The mean of the average reported payloads across 2002, 2012, and 2017 are used. 
    The distance-weighted payload in US short tons as applied for [VEHICLE_CLASS]s
    is [PAYLOAD] tons.

sampling_description: >
    Emissions and activity data for each state are combined to generate an activity-weighted
    average for each region. No uncertainty was assessed.

data_collection_description: >
    MOVES runs were performed using MOVES4.0.1 in 2024.

use_advice: >
    This process is intended to connect to fuel supply processes in the USLCI
    or electricity from the U.S. Electricity Baseline.
